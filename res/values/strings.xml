	    <string name="about_us">This project was created for Yale CS434: Mobile Computing and Wireless Networks, taught
	    by Professor Yang Yang.  A lesson in ad hoc network implementation, the android phone makes a connection
	    to phones with this application installed on it nearby.  The created networks then have a distributed system
	    layered on top in order to facilitate network interaction via chat and file sharing.\n\nFor documentation about this assignment, or others like it, please visit
